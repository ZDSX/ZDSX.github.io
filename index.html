            <strong>Personal evaluation:</strong>I am an optimistic and outgoing person. 
            A little setback won't make me fall. I have performed well academically.
             I really enjoy my major and have achieved good grades in my major courses.
              I think I have also performed well in interpersonal communication.
               I have many friends and have established good relationships with them. 
               In social situations, I can also behave generously and appropriately.
                My body is also very healthy. I often play play badminton or run with my classmates to exercise myself. 
                I have been practicing playing the piano since I was young, and I am also very interested in music. 
                In summary, I believe that I have performed well and have many advantages and strengths. 
                Of course, I also have many shortcomings that need improvement, such as sometimes pursuing perfection too much, lacking confidence, and so on.
                 But I believe that all of these can be improved.

            <strong>About Piano:</strong>
        </p>
        </section>
        <p>When I was in the second grade of elementary school, my parents took me to a concert once. 
            At the beginning, the music for the entire performance was relatively low pitched. Suddenly, a crisp sound came from the grand piano located in the center of the stage. 
            Since then, I have developed a strong interest in the piano. 
            My parents also helped me enroll in piano classes at my request. 
            Over the course of seven years of study, I gradually fell in love with music. 
            My personality has also become more stable. 
            Unfortunately, due to the heavy workload of my studies, I gave up on it after entering high school. 
            But whenever I have free time, I still walk up to the piano to enjoy the joy that music brings me.

        </p>
        <p>Here are a few pictures from my social circle. 
            I like to go out and play and eat with friends in my daily life.
             Of course, I will also record our happy moments together.Figure 1 shows a scenic area called Chong'an Temple in the center of Wuxi City. 
             There are tall buildings all around here, but there are several pavilions here, which are very beautiful.
             The second picture shows the Yuantouzhu Scenic Area of the Taihu Lake Lake.
             It's near our school, and my classmates often go there to play.
             The remaining two pictures are pictures of me and my friends eating together.</p>
